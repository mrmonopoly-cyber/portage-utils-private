all: |
    Show *DEPEND, alias for \fB\-drpb\fR.
key: |
    Advanced option to allow querying the VDB.  This option overrides
    \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-b\fR or \fB\-a\fR.
    \fI<arg>\fR can be any key from Portage's VDB, e.g.\ any file from
    var/db/pkg/<cat>/<pkg>/.
query: |
    Query reverse deps.  This basically reverses the search to any
    package that references \fI<arg>\fR in DEPEND, RDEPEND, PDEPEND or BDEPEND.
    This can be useful to find consumers of a given package, e.g.\ to
    search for packages that have \fIlogwatch\fR in their DEPEND.  Note
    that using versions or range specifiers may yield odd results since
    dependency strings often have ranges themselves.  For installed
    packages, SLOT and SUBSLOTs are available, thus SLOT and antiSLOT
    queries are possible.  See \fBqatom\fR(1).
name-only: |
    Only show category/package, instead of category/package-version.
format: |
    Pretty-print DEPEND declaration to be used in an ebuild.  This
    option initiates a very different mode of operation.  Instead of
    printing searching through packages, it constructs a multi-line
    statement with shell syntax, to be used in an ebuild.  Each
    argument is turned into a separate DEPEND variable declaration.  You
    need to quote dependency strings in order for them to be printed as
    a single dependency declaration.  When used with the \fB\-q\fR
    option, only the pretty-printed dependency declaration is printed,
    e.g.\ the DEPEND= part is skipped.
verbose: |
    Pretty-print atoms output, per DEPEND-variable.  This is much like
    the \fB-f\fR option, but uses as input the dependency info from the
    matches.  When used with \fB-t\fR, the atom highlighting matches
    what is used by the installed package, if available.
quiet: Suppress DEPEND= output for \fB\-f\fR.  Only print the matching
    atom for \fB\-Q\fR.  When given two or more times, suppresses the
    matching atom for \fB\-Q\fR, e.g.\ producing just a list of packages.
