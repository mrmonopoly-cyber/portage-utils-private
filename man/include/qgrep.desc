\fIqgrep\fR searches for a given expression in all ebuilds of the
current portage tree and defined additional overlays.  Optionally the
search is in all eclasses, or just in the ebuilds that are currently
installed.  To narrow the search, multiple targets can be given using
atom syntax.  In particular, the trailing slash (/) syntax can be used
to match an entire category.  See also \fBqatom\fR(1).
