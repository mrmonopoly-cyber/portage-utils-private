\fIqmerge\fR retrieves and installs Gentoo binary packages.  Simple
dependency checking is performed, after which \fIqmerge\fR just unpacks
the binpkg onto the filesystem and registers the package in the VDB.

Retrieval of packages from a remote binhost is currently performed using
\fBwget\fR(1).  More specifically, \fIFETCHCOMMAND\fR is ignored.
