.I qlop
reads from $EMERGE_LOG_DIR/emerge.log and tries to extract
information about merges, unmerges and syncs.  It can
calculate average merge times or just list them.  When given no
arguments or just \fB-v\fR, \fIqlop\fR acts as if \fB-slumt\fR was given
and thus lists the time taken for all occurrances of merges, unmerges
and sync operations found in the log for the last \fBemerge\fR(1) action
performed by Portage.
.P
By default, packages are printed as CATEGORY/PN.  Use \fB-v\fR to print
the package version and revision numbers, e.g\. CATEGORY/PF.  Note that
when using this option, averages (\fB-a\fR) are reported per version
instead of per package.
.P
The non-option arguments to \fIqlop\fR can be any valid atoms.  Multiple
can be given to match.  Since all of these are treated as atoms, version
specifications can be used such as \fB<bash-5\fR.  This allows to zoom
in further on specific packages.
.P
After version \fB0.74\fR of portage-utils, \fIqlop\fR was changed
considerably to be more consistent and more advanced.  Most notably,
this has changed default date output and command line flags.  Instead
of reporting the time the operation finished, \fIqlop\fR now reports the
time the operation started.  The behaviour of the old \fB-g\fR flag is
best matched by the new \fB-t\fR flag.  Similar, the old \fB-t\fR flag
is matched by the new \fB-a\fR flag.
