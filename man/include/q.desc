is a collection of utilities for use with Gentoo systems regarding
installed and available packages.

After version 0.74 of portage-utils, the cache functionality was removed
in favour of using various trees directly, and optionally the caches
therein.  As such the \fB-r\fR and \fB-m\fR options were removed.  It is
no longer necessary to initialise the cache at any time.
.P
After version 0.82, the \fB-m\fR flag got repurposed for listing masks.
