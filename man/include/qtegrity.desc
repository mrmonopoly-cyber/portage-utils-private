The default behavior of \fBqtegrity\fP is to verify digests of performed
executables to a list of known good digests. This requires an IMA-enabled
linux kernel, which records digests of performed executables and exports them
through securityfs. Using \fB\-\-ignore-non-existent\fP suppresses messages
about recorded files that can't be accessed (assuming they got removed).
By using \fB\-\-add\fP, the program behaves differently. No verification is
performed, instead a digest is made of the provided file and appended to
the list of known good digests.
