signas: |
    Sign generated Manifest using GPG key.  This key must exist in your
    keyring and be valid for signing.
passphrase: |
    Ask for GPG key password (instead of relying on gpg-agent).  While
    this option is not very useful compared to gpg's ways of gathering a
    password, it is mainly intended for automated setups where the
    password is piped in using \fIstdin\fR.
