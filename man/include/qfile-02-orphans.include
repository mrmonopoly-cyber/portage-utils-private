.SH "FINDING ORPHAN FILES"
.PP
\fBqfile\fP can also, with the \fB\-\-orphans\fP option, find files
which are not owned by any package.  This behaviour is the opposite of
the usual file owner search: the output is the list of query items for
which no reference has been found in your installed packages database.
As for \fB\-\-quiet\fP, it will completly turn off the output, leaving
just a silent test command, which returns \fI0\fP if and only if there
was no orphan in your query items.

Find the orphan libtool files of your system:
.nf\fI
	$ qfile -o $(find /lib /usr/lib -name "*.la")
	/usr/lib/libGL.la
.fi
.PP
Find the libraries needed by the binary "foo" which have not been installed by
any package:
.nf\fI
	$ qfile -o $(scanelf -nq -F%n#F /path/to/foo | tr , '\\n')
	libinstalledmanually.so.2
.fi
