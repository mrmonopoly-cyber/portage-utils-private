.I qwhich
returns the paths to the ebuilds matching the given atoms.  Searching is
done by default over the main ebuild repository and all configured
overlays.  When requested, a search can be made over the repository of
installed packages (VDB) or binpkg repos.
.P
The default action is to print the full path to the latest ebuild for
each package.  This can be changed using \fB-d\fR to print the directory
the ebuild is in instead.  E.g\. one could \fBcd\fR(1) to this
directory.  Alternatively, one can request to stop searching after the
first match using \fB-f\fR, which means at most one match per repo is
returned.
.P
\fIqwhich\fR accepts atoms to search for, which can be any valid atom,
including e.g\. version specifications to narrow the search.
