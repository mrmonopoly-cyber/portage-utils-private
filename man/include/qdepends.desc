The
.I qdepends
applet has two different modes, forward and reverse dependency querying.
Default operation is forward mode, answering the queries "what does
package X depend on", while reverse mode answers "what packages depend
on X".  Both modes can be further specified into build (DEPEND), run
(RDEPEND), post (PDEPEND) and EAPI7's BDEPEND dependencies.

By default, \fIqdepends\fR returns the unique set of atoms that match
all dependency variables.  To split this out per variable, use \fB-v\fR
option.
.P
Currently,
.I qdepends
defaults to query installed packages.  To query packages from ebuild
trees, use the \fB-t\fR option.
.P
If there is no answer to your query (i.e. you've asked for a package
that is not installed, or a version that does not match), then you will
get empty output.

After version \fB0.74\fR of portage-utils, \fIqdepends\fR was changed
considerably to be more consistent and more advanced.  Most notably,
this has changed default output for reverse mode (\fB-Q\fR).  Instead of
just displaying the package name, like for forward mode, all
dependencies for the package are shown.  When colours are enabled, the
matched atom is highlighted in the list.  In addition to just querying
DEPEND, the default mode changed to query all DEPEND-variables, and
return the unique atoms found in them.  Automatic regular expression
match support was removed.  The \fB-N\fR option was removed, as the same
effect can be achieved via the new \fB-F\fR option or \fB-q\fR option.
The \fB-f\fR option was renamed to \fB-S\fR.
