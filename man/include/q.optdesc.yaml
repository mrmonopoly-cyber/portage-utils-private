overlays: |
    Print available overlays (read from repos.conf).  Use \fI-v\fR to
    see the source (file) where the overlay was declared.
envvar: |
    Print used environment variables and found values.  Use \fI-v\fR to
    see the source (file, environment) where the variable was declared.
    Additional arguments are treated as variable names to print the
    values for.  If just one name is given, only the value is printed if
    matched.  When no arguments or more than one argument is given, the
    variable name and the value is printed as a shell-style declaration.
masks: |
    Print the masks from package.mask files found.  Use \fI-v\fR to see
    the source (file) where the mask was declared.  Use multiple
    \fI-v\fR to print the comment right before the mask.  Additional
    arguments are treated as atom selectors which must match the masks.
